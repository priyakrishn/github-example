This is a customer request to add SMB support in shadow migration. A top customer complaint is that they cannot shadow-migrate file systems
      shared only via SMB. Currently, the shadow migration software supports
      migration only from NFS sources. The customers with a heterogeneous
      environment consisting of both Windows and non-Windows machines are
      frequently advised to use 'robocopy' or 'rsync' command to move the
      data from the Windows machines.
